# GrowthOS

**Autonomous marketing team for Claude Code** — 9 AI agents, 20 skills, 4 MCP servers, one `/grow` command.

## Installation

> GrowthOS is distributed **only via `git clone`** — it is not published on the Claude Code marketplace. The `install.sh` script wires the cloned repo into `~/.claude/plugins/growthOS` so Claude Code discovers every skill, agent, command, and hook as a real slash command (`/grow`, `/growthOS:<skill>`).

### What do I need to install?

The core of GrowthOS (skills, agents, commands, hooks) is pure markdown + YAML — **Claude Code reads it natively, no runtime needed**. Python and Node are only required if you want the optional engines (video rendering, MCP servers, Instagram publisher, carousel export).

| If you want to… | You need |
|------------------|----------|
| Use `/grow`, skills, agents (strategy, copy, content, analysis) | **nothing** beyond Claude Code |
| Render Remotion videos or export carousels to PNG | **Node 18+** (`npm install` inside the repo) |
| Run the MCP servers, the Instagram publisher, or the Python scripts | **Python 3.10+** (`pip install -e shared-lib/`, plus `playwright install chromium` for the IG publisher) |
| Everything | **Node 18+ _and_ Python 3.10+** |

> You don't need to install TypeScript globally — `npm install` pulls `tsc` and all types as local devDependencies for the Remotion project.

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/melgarafael/growthOS.git
cd growthOS
./install.sh
```

What the installer does:

- Creates a symlink `~/.claude/plugins/growthOS → <your clone>` (standard Claude Code plugin discovery path).
- Copies `brand-voice.example.yaml` → `brand-voice.yaml` if you don't have one yet.
- Prints next steps.

After it finishes, **restart Claude Code** (or open a new session) so the new plugin is loaded.

### 2. (Optional) Python & Node dependencies

Only required if you plan to use the MCP servers, the Remotion video engine, or the Instagram publisher:

```bash
# Python shared library (MCP servers, publisher, scripts)
pip install -e shared-lib/

# Node dependencies (Remotion, carousel export)
npm install
```

### 3. (Optional) Docker for MCP servers

If you want the MCP servers running in containers:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Run the onboarding wizard

Inside Claude Code:

```
/grow setup
```

The wizard will guide you through:
1. Setting your brand name and tagline
2. Choosing your tone of voice
3. Selecting your industry
4. Configuring target platforms

It writes to `brand-voice.yaml`, which all agents read to stay on-brand. That file is **gitignored** so your personal brand voice never ends up in the repo.

### Uninstall

```bash
rm ~/.claude/plugins/growthOS
```

### Troubleshooting — slash commands not showing up

If `/grow` or `/growthOS:<skill>` do not appear after install:

1. Confirm the symlink exists: `ls -la ~/.claude/plugins/growthOS`
2. Confirm the manifest: `cat ~/.claude/plugins/growthOS/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
3. Fully restart Claude Code (not just reload — exit the session and reopen).
4. Inside Claude Code, run `/help` to list loaded plugins.

## Quick Start

Once installed, everything goes through `/grow`:

```bash
# Start here — the setup wizard
/grow setup

# Create a growth strategy
/grow strategy "Launch our new SaaS product in Q3"

# Write content
/grow create blog "Why AI is transforming marketing"
/grow create thread "5 growth hacks for startups"
/grow create newsletter "Monthly product update"

# Create visual content
/grow carousel "10 tips for better landing pages"
/grow video reel "Quick product demo"

# Analyze competitors
/grow analyze "competitor X social strategy"

# Research trends
/grow research "AI marketing tools 2026"

# Generate a landing page
/grow landing "New feature launch page"

# Or just describe what you need — the CMO agent routes it
/grow "I need content for our product launch next week"
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GROWTHOS_TWITTER_API_KEY` | For Twitter | Twitter/X API key |
| `GROWTHOS_LINKEDIN_TOKEN` | For LinkedIn | LinkedIn access token |
| `GROWTHOS_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` | For Reddit | Reddit app client ID |
| `GROWTHOS_GITHUB_TOKEN` | For GitHub | GitHub personal access token |
| `GROWTHOS_THREADS_TOKEN` | For Threads | Threads API token |
| `GROWTHOS_VAULT_PATH` | No | Obsidian vault path (default: `./vault`) |
| `GROWTHOS_AUTONOMY_LEVEL` | No | `supervised` \| `assisted` \| `delegated` \| `autonomous` |
| `GROWTHOS_DRY_RUN` | No | `true` \| `false` (default: `true`) |

> **Note:** Social platform API keys are only needed if you want to publish directly. GrowthOS works perfectly for content **generation** without any API keys.

### Brand Voice

Copy `brand-voice.example.yaml` to `brand-voice.yaml` and customize:

```yaml
brand:
  name: "Your Brand"
  tagline: "Your tagline"
  tone:
    - professional
    - conversational
  audience: "Your target audience"
  industry: "Your industry"
```

Or just run `/grow setup` and the wizard handles it for you.

## Safety and Security

GrowthOS is designed with safety-first principles:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dry-run mode** | Enabled by default — no real API calls until you disable it |
| **Progressive autonomy** | 4 levels: `supervised` → `assisted` → `delegated` → `autonomous` |
| **Kill switch** | Instantly revoke all autonomous permissions |
| **Audit logging** | Every action recorded in `.growthOS/audit/` |
| **Circuit breaker** | Auto-stops on repeated API failures |
| **Preview hook** | See exactly what will be published before it goes live |
| **Path validation** | Vault operations prevent directory traversal attacks |
| **Safe rendering** | Remotion uses subprocess isolation to prevent injection |

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the responsible disclosure policy.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- Claude Code CLI

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and wire into Claude Code
git clone https://github.com/melgarafael/growthOS.git
cd growthOS
./install.sh

# Python shared library (development mode)
pip install -e shared-lib/

# Node.js dependencies (Remotion, carousel export)
npm install

# Run tests
cd shared-lib && pytest
```

### What lives in the repo vs. what stays local

GrowthOS ships the **structure** needed to run on any project, but per-project content is gitignored so your personal brand never leaks into the repo. Cloners get empty folders (preserved via `.gitkeep`) and fill them in locally.

| Path | Structure committed? | Content committed? |
|------|----------------------|--------------------|
| `voice/` (golden doc, transcriptions, virals, preferences) | yes | **no — personal** |
| `design-system/` (briefs, HTML, revisions) | yes | **no — personal** |
| `assets/` (logos, photos, screenshots, icons) | yes | **no — personal** |
| `brand-voice.yaml` | example only | **no — personal** |
| `output/{approved,carousels,exports,reviews,revisions}` | yes | **no — runtime** |
| `out/` (rendered videos) | yes | **no — runtime** |
| Playwright artifacts, browser profiles, `.growthos/` | — | **no — runtime** |
| `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `mcp-servers/`, `remotion/`, `shared-lib/`, `templates/` | yes | **yes — reusable framework** |
